  <h1>White Winter Hymnal</h1>
  <h4>Pentatonix</h4>
  <p>I was following the [8x]<br>
<br>
I was following the pack<br>
All swaddled in their coats<br>
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats<br>
To keep their little heads<br>
From fallin' in the snow<br>
And I turned 'round and there you go<br>
And, Michael, you would fall<br>
And turn the white snow red as strawberries<br>
In the summertime<br>

   <br>Hiro Hamada has the mind of a genius and the heart of a 14-year-old. His older brother Tadashi inspires him
   <br> to put his brain to the test in a quest to gain admission to the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology.</p>

    <br> Tadashi Hamada is the older brother of Hiro Hamada and a gifted robotics student at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology.
    <br> Tadashi is the creator of Baymax: a
      robotic, personal, healthcare companion.</p>   </div>

    <br>Baymax was created by the brilliant Tadashi Hamada as a healthcare providing robot nurse for the citizens of San Fransyoko and his brother, Hiro Hamada.
    <br> Tadashi's goal in creating Baymax was to help improve healthcare around the world, basically wanting nothing more than to use his creation and genius for the betterment of humanity.</p>

    <br>She knows what it takes to be fast. She's tough, athletic and loyal to the bone, but not much of a conversationalist.</p>

    <br>Honey may be as sweet as her namesake, but she has a fire in her belly and a can-do attitude that make her pretty much unstoppable.</p>

    <br>Wasabi is committed to precision. He's smart and just a touch neurotic, but the big and burly neatnik can't help but join the cause when Hiro needs him most.
    <br> Wasabi amplifies his martial arts skills with jaw-dropping plasma blade weaponry. Sharp doesnâ€™t even begin to describe this guy.</p>

    <br>Fred is a young comic book enthusiast, with an eccentric personality and a slightly overbearing, yet lovable personality. He is the son of a wealthy couple in the city of San Fransokyo, though he rarely spends quality time with either of them, as they're often away on the family-owned private isles.</p>
